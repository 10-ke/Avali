# Making a feature suggestion
If you have the know-how to code everything yourself, feel free to make a Fork, make your changes, then make a Pull Request. Chances are I'll take a glance over what you added then just plop it in.
Please test your additions before you make the pull request.

# How to make a feature yourself and make the pull request
Head over to github.com/Fevix/Avali and click the button labeled "Fork" in the upper right. 

Once that's done, download and install GitKraken (GitHub has its own desktop application, but it's confusing, GitKraken is a LOT less confusing)
1. Run GitKraken, and just keep clicking next. Once you're through with the 'tutorial' that IMHO doesn't explain enough: 
2. Click the gear in the upper right
3. Click Authentication, then "Github.com"
4. Link GitKraken to your Github account, then return to the main screen 
5. Click the folder icon in the upper left
6. Click Clone, then Github.com
7. Select the Avali item.
8. Click the blue Browse button, and navigate to your Starbound folder. 
9. SINGLE click on the "mods" folder to select, not open, it, then click "OK" or "select" in the bottom right of that screen.
10. Click the green "Clone the repo!" button on the bottom and let it do its thing. It'll create its own /avali folder within the /mods folder you selected previously

Once it's done, that's all the setup you need. You'll be able to make changes on your own machine, create files, etc., You'll only need to do the above once. After you're finished and are ready to upload your changes:

1. Return to GitKraken (You don't need to have kept it open while you modified files, it'll check on launch)
2. On the right side, at the top, you'll see the files you changed. Click the red "Stage all files" button. Head to the bottom and click "unstage" on any files you do not wish to include. 
3. Type a title and description underneath it, then click Commit. 
4. Along the top, you'll see a row of icons. Look for an up arrow. This will push changes from your machine to the online repo. If there have been changes in the online repo, you can use the down arrow to pull them to your machine.
5. When you're satisfied and are ready to send the changes my way, you'll need to open a pull request. This can be done within GitKraken as well. 
6. Look along the left side and find the "Pull Requests" line. Hover over it and a green box with a + inside will appear. Click on this. 
7. In From, select the line with your name in the top box, and "master" in the lower box (Master should automatically be selected)
8. In To, select "Fevix/Avali" in the top box, and again, "master" should be selected in the bottom box (If it's not, select it manually)
9. Type a title and description, then click the green "Create Pull Request" button.
